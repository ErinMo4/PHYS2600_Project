# PHYS2600_Project
Toward the effort of discovering the mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and unlockinganother piece of the two-dimensional quantum phenomena puzzle, insight into the energy band structure of these moire systems and their subsequent quantum transport properties is a vital endeavor, ideally made simpler with theproposed modeling methods in Python.
